    <h2>Why you need to make Pikliz</h2>
        <p>Pikliz is a <em>spicy</em> Haitian pickled slaw made with cabbage, carrots, onions, and Scotch bonnet peppers. Its <em>tangy, fiery</em> crunch pairs perfectly with fried foods, grilled meats, and rice dishes, adding a burst of flavor to every bite.</p>
